# termite_ctrl
Termite: Your local terminal-based version control system 

# Inspo for Termite: 
Combining Terminal and Commit, but that would make termit. So I just converted that into termite BUT THE OTHER REASON is because everytime you run a command, you use mite-init or mite-add or mite-commit, which just sounds like 'might'. Kinda giving off the vibe that "Feeling cute, Might delete later", but in this case it would be like "Feeling cute, mite-rm later". Alright that's enough cornballing.

# Tech Stack:
**Python**: To assist in making the scripts and automation for the local version control system
**Shell**: Incorporated inside the scripting and automation but would be heavily emphasised in the testing component.
(This probably the shallowest tech stack ever, if all tech stacks were layered like burgers, mine would be like a singular pancake(Python) with a drizzle of syrup(Shell). Still deciding what my butter should be to top it all ofðŸ¤”.

# Live Demo:
**COMING SOON**
