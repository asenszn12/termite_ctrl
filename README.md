# termite_ctrl
Termite: Your local terminal-based version control system 

# Inspo for Termite: 
Combining Terminal and Commit, but that would make termit. So I just converted that into termite BUT THE OTHER REASON is because everytime you run a command, you use mite-init or mite-add or mite-commit, which just sounds like 'might'. Kinda giving off the vibe that "Feeling cute, Might delete later", but in this case it would be like "Feeling cute, mite-rm later". Alright that's enough cornballing.

# Tech Stack:
**Python**: To assist in making the scripts and automation for the local version control system.

# Live Demo:
**COMING SOON**
